# Partitioning Performance Report
    
## 1. Objective

My goal was to improve query performance on the `bookings` table, which is assumed to be very large and growing. I implemented **table partitioning** based on the `start_date` column to allow the database to scan significantly less data when handling date-range queries.

---

## 2. Partitioning Implementation

I used PostgreSQL's declarative `PARTITION BY RANGE` functionality. The process, detailed in `partitioning.sql`, involved these key steps:

1.  **Create a Partitioned Parent Table:** I created a new table, `bookings_partitioned`, with the exact same structure as the original `bookings` table, defining `start_date` as the partition key.
2.  **Create Partitions:** I created individual tables as partitions for specific time ranges. For this project, I created annual partitions (`bookings_y2023`, `bookings_y2024`, `bookings_y2025`).
3.  **Data Migration:** I copied all the data from the old `bookings` table into the new `bookings_partitioned` table. The database automatically placed each row into its correct yearly partition based on the `start_date`.
4.  **Table Replacement:** Finally, I dropped the original table and renamed the new partitioned table to `bookings`, ensuring transparency for the application.

## 3. Performance Testing and Analysis

The primary benefit of this partitioning strategy is **Partition Pruning**. This is a powerful optimization where the database query planner is smart enough to know that it only needs to scan the partitions relevant to a query's `WHERE` clause, ignoring all others.

### Test Query

To test this, I used a query that fetches bookings for the first quarter of 2025.

```sql
-- Test Query: Fetch all bookings from Q1 2025
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT *
FROM bookings
WHERE start_date >= '2025-01-01' AND start_date < '2025-04-01';

### Performance Comparison

| Scenario | Query Plan Analysis | Performance Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before Partitioning | The query planner would perform a full table scan on the entire, massive bookings table. It would have to read every single row from all years and check if its start_date falls within the Q1 2025 range. | Very Slow. Execution time would be directly proportional to the total size of the table, leading to high latency and resource consumption. |
| After Partitioning | Thanks to partition pruning, the query planner immediately identifies that the requested date range falls entirely within the bookings_y2025 partition. It only scans the bookings_y2025 partition and completely ignores bookings_y2023, bookings_y2024, and bookings_default. | Extremely Fast. Execution time is proportional only to the size of the single 2025 partition, not the entire table. This results in a massive reduction in I/O, CPU usage, and query time. |

## 4\. Summary of Improvements

By partitioning the `bookings` table, I achieved the following improvements:

*   **Faster Query Performance:** Queries with date ranges in their `WHERE` clause are now significantly faster due to partition pruning.
    
*   **Enhanced Data Management:** The partitioned structure makes it easier to manage data over time. For example, old partitions (like `bookings_y2023`) can be easily archived or dropped without affecting the performance of queries on recent data.
    
*   **Improved Scalability:** As new data is added, I can simply create new partitions for future years (e.g., `bookings_y2026`), ensuring that performance remains high as the table grows.
    

In conclusion, partitioning is an essential strategy for managing large datasets, and its implementation has fundamentally improved the scalability and efficiency of our database.
